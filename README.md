## General Questions
#### 1. What is gradient descent?
#### 2. What's the trade-off between bias and variance?
#### 3. Explain over and under fitting and how to combat them?
#### 4. How do you combat the curse of dimentionality?
#### 5. What is regularization and why do we need it? What are some common methods?
#### 6. Explain Principal Compponent Analysis(PCA)?
#### 7. Why is ReLU better and more often used than Sigmoid in Neural Networks?
#### 8. What is data normalization and why do we need it?
Data normalization is used to rescale values to fit in a specific range to assure better convergence during backpropagation. In general you subtract the mean of each data point to center the dataset to 0 and devide by its standard deviation. This is to make all the features have similar magnitude and have bigger learning rates to converge faster.
